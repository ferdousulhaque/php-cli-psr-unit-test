# PHP CLI Unit Test
For TDD approach of coding, we need to follow the habit of starting to code with writing the unit testing for the codebase. Here in this repository, we will try to add the steps to start solid with the PHP Unit Testing for any feature.

## PSR 4 Auto Loader
Here the psr 4 autoloader is implemented, hence if you put any files inside Src directory you need to run the following command.

```composer dumpautoload```

This is add the new files to the autoloader for using.

## Unit Test Cases
Run the following command for phpUnit Testing to view Tests as well, if don't want to see the tests remove ```--testdox``` from the line.

``` ./vendor/bin/phpunit --testdox```
